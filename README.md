### 🔨 Keep it updated
To ensure your requirements are up to date with the rest of the people working on the project, it is recommended you run `reqs_install.bat` whenever you pull, and `reqs_freeze.bat` whenever you push (pushing can be done using the `pushgit.bat` script, read: **🚀 Push to Github**)

## 🏃 Running the program 
Now you can run the program by typing `py bot.py` in the terminal.

## 🚀 Push to Github
Push your updated code by typing `pushgit.bat "commit message here"`  in the terminal.
-! Make sure you have activated your virtual env before pushing, otherwise the pushed `requirements.txt` will be empty.
